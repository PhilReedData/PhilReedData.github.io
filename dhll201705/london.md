# Digital Humanities Library Lab: Exploring digital collections, 24 May 2017


## Activity: Colour analysis with Gale Cengage Illustrated London News Historical Archive

_ROUGH_

#### Objectives
Analyse an aspect of an entire historical collection using a custom-built tool and begin thinking of questions to ask.

### Overview
_NOTES_
- Gale Cengage collection Illustrated London News Historical Archive 18xx to 2003. 
- Available online through usual browse and search tools.
- This interface suits many uses but does not, for example, allow one to look at the covers of all issues at once.
- We have a hard drive with all issues, as OCR-transcribed text files and image scans.
- We've written a tool to quantify one aspect of the cover image, its average colour, and other tool to show you this data.
- Look at the average colours for each issue, what can you see?
  * Are there trends?
  * Is there a correlation between particular colours and particular dates, such as red during times of economic recession, black during times of war...?
- What else would make this more useful? Text from the cover, charts,...
