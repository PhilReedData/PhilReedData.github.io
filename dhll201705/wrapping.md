# Digital Humanities Library Lab: Exploring digital collections, 24 May 2017
## Wrapping up
It has been quite a challenge to limit what is covered in a three-hour workshop and allow enough time to cover it properly. I will mention a couple of items that sadly did not make the cut.

### Honourable mention: Factiva faster reading

### Another time?:

### Other collections

I am building a new [subject guide](http://subjects.library.manchester.ac.uk/digitalhumanities) for using Library collections in Digital Humanities research. Only the page on Collections is ready to use yet. It lists some of the resources of particular interest.

Please do not share this resource with students yet.

### Copyright and licence agreements
_See the Library's [Copyright Guidance](http://subjects.library.manchester.ac.uk/copyright/) for information and support._

### Conclusions

In this workshop, we have begun to look at how Library collections and resources can be used in Digital Humanities research, and what some of the advantages and challenges of it may include.
