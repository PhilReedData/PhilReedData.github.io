# Digital Humanities Library Lab: Exploring digital collections, 24 May 2017

## Welcome and introduction

### Aims
In this workshop, we will begin to look at how Library collections and resources can be used in Digital Humanities research, and what advantages and challenges may arise. See also the [3 March workshop](../dhll201703/index.html).

### Introductory show case
Before we get into any hands-on examples, I would like to show a more extensive project which uses historical publications, text mining and analysis, image mining and anlysis.

> "Few magazines can boast being continuously published for over a century, familiar and interesting to almost everyone, full of iconic pictures â€” and also completely digitized and marked up as both text and images. What can you do with over 2,700 covers, 400,000 pages, 6 TB of data? Students, librarians and faculty are excited about the possibilities of working with Vogue to explore questions in fields from gender studies to computer science."
