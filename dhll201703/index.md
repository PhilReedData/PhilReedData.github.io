# Digital Humanities Library Lab: Exploring digital collections, 3 March 2017

## Aims of the workshop
This workshop is for researchers in the Faculty of Humanities at The University of Manchester who wish to continue exploring digital collections at The University of Manchester Library. The ideas and techniques that you will see and have hands-on experience with might inspire you to develop further Digital Humanities research projects. You will look at digital text collections from publishers at platforms such as JSTOR, Jisc, Adam Matthew and Gale Cengage, using light-touch text and data mining techniques. Some of the activities will involve using a bit of Python code; however, the workshop assumes you may have no prior programming experience.

The event is scheduled for 2pm to 5pm on Friday, 3 March 2017 (breaking around 3.30pm for coffee).
Location: Teaching Suite (Blue 4), Main Library, The University of Manchester Library.
Computers will be available, though you may bring your own laptop if you wish.
