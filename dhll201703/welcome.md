# Digital Humanities Library Lab: Exploring digital collections, 3 March 2017

## Welcome and introduction

### Aims
In this workshop, we will begin to look at how Library collections and resources can be used in Digital Humanities research, and what advantages and challenges may arise.

### Introductory show case
Before we get into any hands-on examples, I would like to show a more extensive project which uses historical newspapers, text mining and analysis, together with GIS for an interactive map to explore the newly constructed data set.

Runner up of the BL Labs Competition (2016):
__Black Abolitionist Performances and their Presence in Britain__
_By Hannah-Rose Murray, PhD student with the Department of American and Canadian Studies, University of Nottingham_

> "__[Black Abolitionists](http://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2016/11/black-abolitionist-performances-and-their-presence-in-britain-an-update.html){:target="_blank"}__ was the runner up of the BL Labs Competition (2016). Hannah-Rose's project focuses on African American lives, experiences and lectures in Britain between 1830–1895. By assessing black abolitionist speeches in the British Library’s nineteenth-century newspaper collection and using the [British Library’s Flickr Commons 1 million collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/){:target="_blank"} to illustrate, the project has illuminated their performances and how their lectures reached nearly every corner of Britain. For the first time, the location of these meetings has been mapped and the number and scale of the lectures given by black abolitionists in Britain has been evaluated, allowing their hidden voices to be heard and building a more complete picture of Victorian London for us.
