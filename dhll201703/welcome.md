__Black Abolitionist Performances and their Presence in Britain__
_By Hannah-Rose Murray, PhD student with the Department of American and Canadian Studies, University of Nottingham_

> "__[Black Abolitionists](http://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2016/11/black-abolitionist-performances-and-their-presence-in-britain-an-update.html){:target="_blank"}__ was the runner up of the BL Labs Competition (2016). Hannah-Rose's project focuses on African American lives, experiences and lectures in Britain between 1830–1895. By assessing black abolitionist speeches in the British Library’s nineteenth-century newspaper collection and using the [British Library’s Flickr Commons 1 million collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/){:target="_blank"} to illustrate, the project has illuminated their performances and how their lectures reached nearly every corner of Britain. For the first time, the location of these meetings has been mapped and the number and scale of the lectures given by black abolitionists in Britain has been evaluated, allowing their hidden voices to be heard and building a more complete picture of Victorian London for us.
