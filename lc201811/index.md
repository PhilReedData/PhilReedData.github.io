If you do not have administrator rights, you can still install OpenRefine to your local hard drive (C:\Work). 
This method requires you to have Java already installed (available from the Software Center). 
OpenRefine will not work if you install it to a network drive such as your P: drive.
Check that you have Edge, the Firefox or the Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser.
        <strong>OpenRefine runs in your default browser.</strong>
        It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.

      <p>Download software from <a href="http://openrefine.org/">http://openrefine.org/</a></p>
      <p>Save it to the C:\Work directory "This PC > OS (C:) > Work".</p>
      <p>Unzip the downloaded file into the OpenRefine directory by right-clicking and selecting "7-Zip > Extract Here". </p>
      <p>Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.</p>
      <p>Launch OpenRefine by clicking <code>openrefine.exe</code> (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that - just wait for OpenRefine to open in the browser).</p>
      <p>If you are using a different browser, or if OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3333/">http://127.0.0.1:3333/</a> or <a href="http://localhost:3333">http://localhost:3333</a> to use the program.</p>
